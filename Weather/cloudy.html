<h1><i> MIXED EMOTIONS</i></h1>

<h3>
	Starting a new chapter at college was without doubt a really exciting experience. However, after a few weeks, I started feeling confused. Although I enjoy hanging out with my friends and my new-found liberty, I feel destabilized and confused about my future. Is what I'm studying contributing to my future or just a waste of time? The short winter days and the late evening bus rides deepen my cloudy thoughts.
